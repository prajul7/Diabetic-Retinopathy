# Diabetic Retinopathy Detection

Welcome to the Diabetic Retinopathy Detection project!  
This project uses machine learning to detect Diabetic Retinopathy (DR) from retina images.

---

## üìñ Project Overview

Diabetic retinopathy is a diabetes complication affecting the eyes. Early detection is crucial to prevent vision loss.  
This project leverages deep learning models (VGG16, MobileNet, etc.) to classify retina images into DR severity levels.

Key Features:
- Detect diabetic retinopathy from retina images
- Pre-trained deep learning models included
- Integrated on Mobile Application

## üì¶ Download Pre-trained Models

The trained models are available on Google Drive:

[Download Models](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1FIS8AevAMfvLMRsUfumYo_4qrQdsvQKc)

- Place the downloaded models in the Model/ folder before running the scripts.
